# Instructions
#### 1. Open the `main_code.ipynb` notebook to view and run the primary code.
#### 2. Due to limited image data in the repository, results may differ from those generated in a full dataset context.

# Note:
This repository is for demonstration purposes only, showcasing the offset calculation methodology with a subset of images. This project is conducted in collaboration with TTU APD Lab and contains sensitive data. As a result, only a few sample images are provided in this repository. The complete code is designed to handle 80+ images, so you may notice different output results in the notebook as image data is restricted.
